Contribution Guide
==================

We welcome contributions from anyone willing to put in the time and effort to help us.

Some guidelines:

* We use the github `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/hasadna/okscraper/issues>`_ for our issue management.

* You can select an issue to work on from our issue tracker, just write in the comment of the issue that you are working on it.

* Fell free to open a new issue, just be sure to check first in our issue tracker if a similiar issue doesn't exist.

* Please don't send us big Pull Requests. It makes reviewing and ensuring correctness hard. If possible, break it to smaller commits and pull requests.

* Please send pull requests related to issues in our issue tracker. If a relevant issue doesn't exist you can create it.

* If you are not familiar with contributing to github projects, please follow `this guide <http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/>`_ about committing, forking, branching and sending pull requests.
